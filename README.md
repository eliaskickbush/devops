This project aims to be a fully functional stack for running applications, with assumptions listed.

The current stack is:

* *Kubernetes*, for container orchestration
* *Terraform*, for infrastructure as code
* *Atlantis*, as terraform orchestrator
* *Harbor*, for container registry.
* *AWS*, for anything, but mostly EC2, VPC, S3.
* *Drone*, for CI.
* *Argo* for random workloads
